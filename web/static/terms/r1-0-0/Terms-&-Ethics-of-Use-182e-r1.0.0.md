# 00. - Important notes

- In agreeing with these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, you agree to also be in agreement with, understanding of and acceptance of future iterations of our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
- These apply to all products, services and experiences distributed under or by the oreohive organisation, or any content created by, facilitated by, provided by or solicited by the oreohive organisation.
You may not under any circumstances use, connect to or interact with any of these without being in agreement with these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
- Largely in order to prevent abuse, we deem even your connection to our services or resources for the sole purposes of reading these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License as an agreement to use our services, products, platforms and experiences within (the confines of) these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
- With this being said, we do not bar you from, or restrict your viewership of, our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, even if you have not formally and explicitly confirmed your acceptance with them via a UI element, because we think that would be silly.
- The assumption, though, is that in connecting with our services for any reason whatsoever (including reading these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License):
    - you’re in agreement with these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License,
    - find yourself in sincere agreement with and understanding of what they outline, and
    - agree to utilise, interact with or connect to our services, products, platforms or experiences in accordance with (and within the confines defined by) our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
- In using our services, agreement with our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License is not optional. It’s a compulsory measure that is assumed given any amount of engagement with us, our platforms or our services.
This even includes communicating with us via external means, like email (even if this isn’t facilitated by our own domain), or accessing our resources via third-party services and / or external domains.
- No part of these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License is optional, but we do encourage feedback surrounding it. Please reach out to us via our official means of contacts if you have any questions, queries, qualms or ideas for improving our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
- It might seem ridiculous for an organisation so focused on freedoms and liberties to utilise such an extensive scheme as these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, but we outline these to protect both ourselves and you as an end user. It’s largely up to our own discretion as an organisation whether we choose to act upon these in any given circumstance, or deem a behaviour or action by anyone or any entity in violation of these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
- We promise to be what we deem reasonable in our enforcement and policing of these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License. We may deal with cases (of potential or definite violation) on a case-by-case basis and in our own time.
We would only ever wish to reach a conclusion that is beneficial, constructive and protective, both of ourselves and our end users, including any potential violators, within reason and our own judgements.

# 01. - Introduction

This document, and its series of segmented pieces clearly specified within ‘sections’, form the oreohive Source No-AI-Training License of the oreohive organisation.
By using any of our (the oreohive organisation’s) works, you agree to the oreohive Source No-AI-Training License in its entirety.

This includes you using, consuming, manipulating, sharing, distributing, altering, downloading or retrieving our work for any purposes and for any manner, be this for personal viewership, incorporation into your own content or materials, or any such use.

By using any of the works, materials or content of (or provided by) the oreohive organisation, or any such works under its name, you agree to do so within the confines and guidelines laid out in this document.

# 02. - Definitions and clarities

***This section provides details, context and clarity on definitions of words we may use throughout this document and any sub-documents within or referenced here that may exist.
It also details how we may be referred to throughout, and how we may refer to other things surrounding, detailing, comprising of or constituting our products, services and / or experiences, or the oreohive organisation as a whole (in and of itself).***

### 2.1 - Who we are

We are the oreohive organisation (‘we’, ‘our’, ‘us’).

‘the oreohive organisation’ is the name of the organisation that currently manages the [oreohive.org](http://oreohive.org) domain, the websites hosted there (including ones of any subdomains).
We, as ‘the oreohive organisation’ hold the ‘oreohive’ brand identity.

Throughout this oreohive Source No-AI-Training License document, its sections, and other, perhaps similar means of documentation, we might be called different things (referred to in different ways).
In such texts and documents, we, the oreohive organisation, may be referred to with the following names, pseudonyms or phrases:

- ‘(the )oreohive org(anisation)’
- ‘(the )oreohive’ (simply oreohive)
- ‘(the )beehive’
- ‘oreohive.org’ (currently our main domain name)

It should remain obvious throughout these documents when we refer to ourselves, but you may use this for reference. Any such terms may be used to refer to us, though we try to remain clear and transparent with a human reader.

### 2.2 - What ‘the oreohive project’ actually is

‘(the) oreohive project’ is just the name we give to our collection of software, services, products, projects and materials that we publish under the oreohive umbrella or name.

For example, our website, currently being hosted at oreohive.org, is part of the oreohive project; we publish and manage it under the oreohive name.

If we were to create such an asset, service, product or material and publish it under a very distinct name rather than ‘oreohive’, this might not be part of the oreohive project.
This could be the case in such a scenario even if we’re open about being ‘the oreohive organisation’ in or behind its development, creation, maintenance or publication.

However, for our purposes, and for the sake of maintaining consistency, one may assume that any instance of such a project or asset where it’s found to be unclear is indeed part of the oreohive project.

We declare what is part of the oreohive project and what is not.
By default, all assets and resources we create and / or publish under ‘the oreohive organisation’ is indeed a part of ‘the oreohive project’.

### 2.3 - About the [oreohive.org](http://oreohive.org) domain (name) and our website

We currently own, maintain and manage (the rights to) the domain name [oreohive.org](http://oreohive.org) via our registrar, who reserves all rights of their own regardless of this oreohive Source No-AI-Training License document. This may not be the case forever; right now, we most certainly have no plans to discontinue our use of this domain or cease our payments for it, as it’s largely central to our identity.

However, it’s important to note that our website and our domain name are indeed two separate entities, the former of which can be hosted independently of the latter. Both our acquisition and ownership of the domain name, and the website(s) we host there, including those on any subdomains, are all part of the oreohive project, and are all managed by us, the oreohive organisation.

### 2.4 - Our stuff

Any ‘service’ we refer to throughout these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License of our own covers any experience, software (web(site/page)-hosted or otherwise) provisioned by, created by, maintained by or published by the oreohive organisation, or any such service the oreohive organisation currently holds the rights to / rightfully owns or manages.
It also includes any products or services of any kind we offer, fulfil or provide to you or any given consumer, any tools, assets, works or materials we may publish as the oreohive organisation, or our development, publishing or maintenance of any of these.

When we refer to an ‘asset’, a (piece of) ‘material’, a ‘product’, or (some) ‘content’ as ‘ours’ (belonging to the oreohive organisation), we are usually referring to and are including in our statement any asset, piece of material, product, service, artwork, creation, supply, image/photo, video, piece of code (be it exemplary, functional/operational in our delivery of our services, or something else) we publish under the oreohive organisation, regardless of whether it is a part of the oreohive project (or not).

These oreohive Source No-AI-Training License cover all products, services and assets (published, maintained, owned or developed) by the oreohive organisation, regardless of said asset, service or product’s status as in or a part of ‘the oreohive project’ or otherwise. As such, your use of any resource (owned or published) by the oreohive organisation is to be governed by these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, as described earlier.

### 2.5 - How this oreohive Source No-AI-Training License document, and these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, interface with, correspond to and engage with other licences, licensing agreements and laws (restrictions take charge)

*In the event of a contradiction between these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, any other such documentation / guidelines we may publish or any licenses (usually published by third parties, like the Free Software Foundation) we may employ or use in publishing our resources, restrictions always take charge, and ALWAYS overrule freedoms.*

It should not usually be the case that this document’s information clashes with the information provided by the other licenses we use to distribute our content under, and such licensing agreements we leverage, which are typically from third parties.

For example, by default, **we license ALL of the assets and media we share under the oreohive organisation under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**, unless it’s **code** or inside **a programming language**, in which case, **we license it under the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0 (oreohive Source No-AI-Training License (most recent version available))**.

For clarity, to largely reiterate, ALL assets and media we publish under the oreohive organisation or on our oreohive platforms, (sub)domains, websites, repositories or services, is, by default, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

This is with the exception of code, or text assets that are of a programming language; we license all of these pieces of code or language scripts under the oreohive Source No-AI-Training License (most recent version available) instead.
As stated, both of these are defaults; if we state that any of our assets, media or content is licensed otherwise, this may not apply.

However, with this example in mind, it’s important for you to understand that:

- restrictions within other such licenses and Terms we use are not overruled by (freedoms granted in) this document, and
- restrictions within this document are not overruled by (freedoms granted in) other such licenses and Terms we use.

Should this document or these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License contradict any other licenses or rules we use, please reach out to us via our official contact information.
However, by default, restrictions take charge. If a pair take two separate approaches and both come to apply, the most restrictive of the two approaches is to take charge.

If one license or collection of Terms (& Ethics of Use) is being applied that grants a freedom, but another we apply restricts this, the restriction takes charge.

This might be a mistake, so once more, please reach out to us, and we may be able to fix this by, say, amending our own documentation or Terms.
However, for now, restrictions take charge, for the purposes of keeping our content safe.

# 03. - Communications

***This section details your right to opt out of our communications that may be sent, broadcasted or distributed as an effort to promote our own products, services and experiences, or those of any affiliates or sponsors.
Even though we don’t do or offer any of this at the time of writing and publication, we issue this information pre-emptively in case we ever do.*** 

By using our services, you agree to acknowledge that you may receive communications from us via contact details you may provide to us at (perhaps at any point throughout, within or outside of your use of our services or assets).

By using our services, you agree to understand that you may unsubscribe or opt out from some of our communications.
At the time of writing and publishing this document, we currently hold absolutely no plans to serve or send marketing or promotional electronic messages.

However, should we ever deliver these, we are obligated by law to provide a method through which you can easily unsubscribe, or indicate to us that you no longer wish to receive these emails. We would then wish to, and be obligated to, respect this choice.

The only emails that you might not be able to unsubscribe from may involve:

- Security
- Updates to terms, which you agree to follow in your use of our services, such as these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License
- Account activity
- Protection of your information, data, account, profile, or personalisation

Blocking these means of communication on your end that we do not offer the ability to unsubscribe from ourselves is also in violation of these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
You agree as part of these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License not to block or impair our such means of communicating such critical information with you, since this could impair our ability (as the oreohive organisation) to properly protect and safeguard your data, yourself and / or the use of your products, services and experiences that are provisioned, published, maintained, managed and / or owned by the oreohive organisation.

As previously noted, we currently don't plan to implement any such system through which we directly issue, to our users, promotional materials or marketing messages through electronic means.
In addition, a philosophy of ours is to collect as little personal information as we can while maintaining enough to be able to improve our services, or at least provide them to you as intended.
This is why we would likely require such promotional materials or messaging to be opt-in; such a scheme would require the user to specify explicitly that they wish to subscribe to receive these kinds of communications.

Also, we currently, at the time of typing this document, don't provide a way for users to create an account or profile with us. This may change in the future, hence the provision and specification of this part of our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
We may allow for the creation of an account with us in order to enable or improve certain functions or features within our (provision of) services or experiences. However, an aim of ours is to ensure that this is not usually mandatory in order to utilise these services or experiences of ours, within reason and feasibility. In some circumstances, we may require a means of registration in order to prevent the abuse of our services, products or experiences, most of which available directly via our website we usually attempt to offer for public availability.

# 04. - Distribution of your own content on our platforms

***This section describes and provides details on what’s entailed if you decide to publish or upload your own (perhaps custom) content to our platforms, software, services, products, websites or experiences.***

At some point(s), our products or services might allow you (as a ‘user’) to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material (’content’).

the oreohive organisation has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit all content provided by users. we are advocates for freedom in the use of our platforms and services, but we do not and will not have this used to make way for or allow for hateful speech and language, discrimination, or any other such hateful or discriminatory / excluding expression.

We don't provide these resources for use by for-profit entities or corporations. They’re not for for-profit or corporate / business / entrepreneurial endeavours.

By agreeing to these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License and / or making any of your user content available through this service, you hereby grant to the oreohive organisation a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide and royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, host, cache, use, store, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, modify (usually for formatting purposes only) or distribute this user content solely in connection with operating and providing our products, services, experiences, materials, content and assets to you and, often depending on your own discretion, to other users, individuals and / or organisations.

You may use our products, services (including tools, apps, and other such programs) and experiences only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.

We are able to reasonably dictate what is in compliance with our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, and what is not.

What we mean by this is that we may declare something in violation of these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, but only with reasoning we feel is legitimately fair, reasonable, in good faith, and in compliance with a given legitimate interpretation of the oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.

Additionally, should something be in violation of our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, we reserve the right to act on our own accordance and, ultimately, refuse to or decide not to act accordingly in penalising the offending party, product, service or provision.

A perceived ‘failure’, unwillingness or inability to act in defence of our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, or a perceived ‘failure’, unwillingness or inability to penalise or act against (legally or otherwise) a party, product, service or provision in violation of our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, should NOT be considered a waiver or formal, official or legal excuse or pardon of the violating party, product, service, content or material, or the discontinuation of (or ceasing of the enforcement of) a given term, clause, sentence, phrase, rule or guideline stated in these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.

# 06. - No use of our content, assets or materials for training or improving AI models or neural networks

***This section details how one is strictly disallowed and not permitted to use any of our content, assets or materials, or anything from our products, services, software or experiences, to train, improve or contribute to the development of AI models or neural networks.***

In agreeing to these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, you agree to never, under any circumstance, utilise, use or employ our content, assets, materials, (copies, screenshots or renders of) our software, services, platforms, products and experiences).

The only possible exception would be delivered or carried out in the form of an official exception issued by an official communication by the oreohive organisation @ oreohive.org, via one of our official communication avenues (usually by email).

- If the exception does not provide a future time at which it becomes inactive that is at least a week (or 168 hours, whichever is sooner) in the future from the transmission or sending of the communication, it is invalid and not to be considered official.
- If the exception does not provide a future time at which the exception is to expire, no more than a year after the date and time at which it is to come into action, it is invalid and isn’t to be considered official.
- If the exception was sent by a party that has managed to compromise such an avenue of communication, or the exception was sent at a time at which the oreohive organisation’s infrastructure or account(s) were compromised or under the influence or control of another party or individual, the exception is rendered invalid and is not to be considered official.

It is up to you to discover and learn of the validity of such a communication, in this case / such cases.

We, as the oreohive organisation, the individuals providing the content in question, reserve the right to, at any point:

- ask you, one or a party to cease (your) operations, either within twenty four hours or at once, in using our data, assets, resources, materials, media or works for (such) AI / neural network / algorithm training, development, growth, progress or teaching
- ask you, one, or a party to delete any AI model, such (computational or otherwise) instance of an artificial (general or otherwise) intelligence or neural network and / or the database or training memory / data / information it holds containing or influenced by the oreohive organisation’s / oreohive.org’s content
- legally penalise you, one or a party for failing to comply with such requests, issue fines, or otherwise follow up with legal actions or repercussions.

Regardless of any exception provided, official or otherwise, or ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE, you agree that any use of our assets and materials remains entirely at our discretion as the oreohive organisation, and our judgement(s) are not to be and must not be ignored in regards to your training of AI or neural networks using our content or data.

You agree and understand that, in agreeing with these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, that you are NOT to use ANY of our content, media, assets, materials, photos, videos, drawings, audio files, code or ANY OTHER MATERIAL OR ASSETS PUBLISHED BY THE OREOHIVE ORGANISATION, CREATED BY THE OREOHIVE ORGANISATION OR AUDITED / DISTRIBUTED BY THE OREOHIVE ORGANISATION, for the training of, contribution towards, teaching of, testing of, development of, or instruction of AI models, AI databases, neural networks, or ANY such computational or algorithmic means, including ANY database or (memory) location that is to be used, under any circumstance or in any capacity, to train such AI models, AI databases or neural networks.

### In other, perhaps less formal words, don’t use our stuff as training data for AI. Ever.

We reserve the right to, at any point, (request or attempt to) stop you from doing this, even if you have been granted an exception, and in agreeing to these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, you agree to honour our such wishes, even in the face of or despite potential technical restrictions.

### Should you be granted an exception officially by us, you reserve the right to reason that this exception was issued by the oreohive organisation as a written, explicit permission to do as it permits, with the content it permits, in the time period or duration it specifically permits.
In addition, we shan’t penalise you for conducting tasks or activities within the bounds, confines and definitions of what such an exception has permitted you to.

Should it transpire at any point, by any means and in any circumstance that this permission or exception was provided by another party (acting on behalf of the oreohive organisation or otherwise), this right expires and was never valid or granted.

# 07. - **Analytics and telemetry**

***This section details how we use and employ analytics and telemetry as efforts to help us gain insights into how our product is used among our users. It also explains that we aim to be transparent when questioned about it.***

We may use third-party service providers, services, applications, products or schemes to monitor and analyse the (your, or a ‘user’’s) use of our products, services and experiences.
We aim to maintain a transparency about how we may go about doing this.

We might not answer any and all related questions in the likes of these documents, but should this prove to be the case (in the lack of an answer for a question of your own), we encourage you to get in touch with us via our official means of communication.

We pledge to maintain a transparency about the kinds of data we collect. We’re not even just writing this to seem cool or to be all professional or corporate about it; we legitimately and personally care about this.

At the time of writing, we have no concrete plans in regards to analytics, but we do intend on implementing them at some point in the future.
Right now, we may have enabled Cloudflare’s means of analytics. Cloudflare acts as our domain registration company and cache / ‘CDN’. We may also have enabled Vercel’s means of analytics. Vercel is currently, at the time of writing this, our web hosting service company of choice due to the ease they introduce in the provision of their services, but this may be subject to change.

### Our choice of analytics or approaches to analytics, telemetry or such means of user data collection is very much subject to change, and may change to degrees that are no longer specifically reflected by these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License in the future.

However, we agree to ensure transparency, and maintain (and uphold) a respect for the privacy of our users in the collection of such data, in addition to a respect for their right to opt out of unnecessary data collections that don’t constitute to core or integral parts of the functionality of the services, products or experiences they receive from us or via our platforms or avenues of communication or delivery.

# 08. - **No use by under-13s**

***This section discusses and outlines how our services are not for use by individuals under the age of thirteen. Using this service under the age of thirteen or letting your child do so is a strict and direct violation of our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.***

Service is intended only for access and use by human individuals at least thirteen (13) years old. By accessing or using our products, services or experiences, you warrant and represent that you are at least thirteen (13) years of age and with the full authority, right, and capacity to enter into this agreement and abide by all of the terms and conditions of Terms. If you are not at least thirteen (13) years old, you are prohibited from both the access and use of our products, services and experiences.

### If you’re somehow under the age of thirteen (13) but are reading this, we wholeheartedly and really do appreciate your interest in us, but please wait before establishing an internet presence and engaging with our products, services or experiences; you usually tend to pick much better usernames when you get older, trust us.

# 09. - **Accounts**

***This section talks about how you may make an account or profile with us and what rights we (the oreohive organisation) hold in you doing so, along with how you must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of related security breaches and / or the like.***

When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on our products, services or experiences.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account (’s personal details and credentials) and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and / or password, whether your password is with our product(s), service(s) or experience(s) or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately (via our official communication avenues) upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your account, so we can ensure to the best of our ability that this is handled properly.

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than
