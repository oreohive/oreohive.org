Release 1.0.0
made by and for the oreohive organisation (@ oreohive.org)

This document (featuring our Terms of Purchasing & Exchange) is intended to be bundled with our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.
Agreeing to our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, as is mandated by and implied by any usage of or engagement with our (the oreohive organisation's) products, services or experiences, involves agreeing to these Terms of Purchasing & Exchange, too.

# Terms of Purchasing & Exchange

# 1. - Purchases

If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through our services (’purchase’), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase and its completion.
This could include, but may not be limited to:

- Credit or debit card number
- Expiration date on such a card
- A billing address
- Shipping information

By agreeing to these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, you agree that(i) you have the legal right to use any card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any purchase, and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, complete and in good faith.

We may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion and / or processing of purchases. 
By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to these oreohive Source No-AI-Training License, and any more such documentation we may provide.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to:

- product or service availability,
- errors in the description or price of the product or service,
- error in your order
- or other reasons.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorised or illegal transaction is suspected.

# 2. - Subscriptions

Some parts of Service might be billed on a subscription basis (’subscription(s)’). You’ll be billed in advance on a recurring and/or periodic basis (’Billing Cycle’).
Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a subscription. Such details should be presented upfront and before the confirmation of a purchase or subscription / billing cycle.

At the end of each billing cycle, your subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or the oreohive organisation cancels it.
You may cancel your subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting oreohive.org@gmail.com customer support team.

A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription.
You shall provide the oreohive organisation with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full name, address, province / state, the likes of a postal code or zip code, phone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorise the oreohive organisation to charge all subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the oreohive organisation reserves the right to terminate your access to the service, even with immediate effect, though we won’t typically do this.

# 3. - F**ree trials**

the oreohive organisation may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (as a ‘free trial’).

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for a free trial, you will not be charged by the oreohive organisation until this free trial has expired.
On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your subscription, you may be automatically charged the applicable subscription fees for the type of subscription you’ve selected.

At any time and without notice, the oreohive organisation reserves the right to (i) modify the terms (of service) of such a free trial offer, or (ii) cancel such a free trial offer.

# 4. - **Fee changes**

the oreohive organisation, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify subscription fees for the subscriptions.
Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. the oreohive organisation should provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of service after subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.

It’s worthy of note that we will usually attempt to ‘do the right thing’ in compliance with our ethical and moral values, so will be incredibly, impeccably unlikely to incur substantial price increases without lots of notice.

# 5. - Refunds

We, by default, would issue refunds for contracts or purchases within fourteen days of the original purchase of the contract or purchase, upon the potential sale of a product or service, if we find or are given reasoning we deem appropriate, sufficient, satisfactory and / or in good faith.
