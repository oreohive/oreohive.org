# licensing and resource usage

any media, content, resources, assets or materials, like code, pictures, videos, images or any other such materials published by the oreohive organisation are, by default, licensed under the oreohive Source No-AI-Training License.

this means you can modify, distribute and use the code **so long as you**:
- give **appropriate attributions** (give appropriate credit to the original source of 'the oreohive organisation @ oreohive.org')
- provide a **link to the license**, and indicate if changes to the code were made, and
- release the code, **including any changes you may make**, under the **same license** (the version of the gnu agpl currently used by the code you used from us, or a later one at your discretion).
- do so **within the confines**, **boundaries**, **rules**, **limitations** and **guidelines** as stated by the **most recent publication** of our **oreohive Source No-AI-Training License**, which you can find [here](https://www.oreohive.org/onboarding).

# our identity

### oreohive branding and marks
oreohive branding, oreohive marks, oreohive mascots or other such / related assets included in the repo, the website or any materials we may publish are protected under ***copyright*** means.

as such, you cannot use them under the same terms of either of these licenses.

you're allowed to **either**:
- host a completely **unaltered**, freely-available, open-source, unmodified version of the oreohive.org website or api with branding for **non-commercial**, **not-for-profit** purposes, or

- host a **greatly / significantly modified**, significantly built-upon version of the oreohive.org website as a 'fork' without any of the branding (including the name) but with significant and appropriate attributions to the oreohive organisation @ oreohive.org, clearly stating that you built the website upon our work at oreohive.org.

ultimately, what is considered 'greatly / significantly modified' is up to our discretion, but this is something we'd consider ourselves really quite fair about.

### conclusion, and oreohive Source No-AI-Training License
in general, **it's highly unlikely you'll find us chasing people or entities over licensing crap if they're doing us no direct harm**. this is just to stop naughty people stealing our stuff without giving back to the community.

means of using or adapting our oreohive branding, name, oreohive marks or other such / related assets (included in this repo or otherwise) that are not explicitly allowed are strictly prohibited.
our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License take precedence over any of these licensing agreements, licenses or licensing terms. please find them at our website.

any and all of **your use of oreohive resources, resources published by the oreohive organisation** are **subject to our oreohive Source No-AI-Training License**. please find them on our website.

sensible inclusions of the oreohive(.org) name or logo in attributions, clearly as an effort to attribute or give credit rather than impersonate, do not count as infringing or disallowed use of the oreohive name or marks.
