                <h3>raise awareness</h3>
                <p>
                    tell the world about oreohive.org.
                    <br /><br />we're planning on bringing tutorials about
                    technology to the wider world in an accessible flavour; this
                    is hard for us to perfect, so things can take a while, but
                    we get there, and by the end, it tends to be pretty cool!
                    <br><br>
                    we're working on some pretty fun content for our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@oreohive">youtube</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>buy our merch</h3>
                <p>just kidding. would be really cool, though. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oreohive.org">who up?</a></p>
