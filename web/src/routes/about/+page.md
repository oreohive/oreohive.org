## the what and the why
the oreohive organisation's very limited experience in writing code is pretty much entirely exclusive to basic backend stuff.

however, we wanted to make a website because we felt it would be the best way to make the resources we intend on sharing with the world publicly available and accessible without the friction of downloading an app.
as trivial as downloading an app may seem to you and i in our present age, we really want to make this as easy, simple and frictionless as possible.

not everyone is you and i, and personally, i'm quite tired with the shed loads of apps on my phone anwyay.

## our pledge to you
**we want the beehive to remain a publicly-available, clean, accessible and intuitive resource to help people make awesome things.** *that* is why we're here.

in other words, **we want to help fellow hobbyists achieve their goals, or at least achieve progress, in their projects**.

we're just a bunch of silly nerds, and we felt like we wanted a clean, minimal hub of resources and docs that is free of annoying ads, intrusive tracking, slow load times, account requirements or offensive paywalls.

this means no / minimal ads or promotional material, no bloat, no excessive tracking, no mandated account credentials, no spamming of emails with promotional efforts, and no sacrifice to the user experience in a blind chase of profits.

in your viewership of, visiting of, utilisation of and engagement with the beehive at oreohive.org (and the content hosted there), we view this as a trust you place in us to deliver information you may seek and respect your time.

as such, we intend fully on standing by our pledge to make a fresh, clean, minimal, friendly and fast place to access resources, tips, tricks and details about nerdy things we find interesting.

as the world becomes increasingly technological, we deem it an injustice that the general public is being told to adapt to technology. we believe that humans shouldn't need to adapt to technology, and technology should adapt to humans instead.

# faq (hypoFetically Askable Questions)

### - q: **what is the beehive?**
- a: 'the beehive' is just the name we give to the website hosted at oreohive.org, and all content we host (usually via our web services) under the oreohive project for public availability.

  the beehive is just this place, really!

### - q: **what is the oreohive project?**
- a: 'the oreohive project' is simply the name we give to the collection of resources, assets, materials and efforts published by the oreohive organisation for general availability, and the initiative(s) behind them.

  as such, the beehive is a part of the oreohive project of the oreohive organisation.

  the oreohive organisation may publish resources that aren't under the oreohive project (in which case, they will likely feature little to no oreohive branding bar a mention that it's of the oreohive organisation), but they are to be considered a part of the oreohive project by default.
  
  these resources are to help people learn about a variety of things.
  while our centre of our attention in these regards tends to be technology, homelab and development (what one could call 'computational creativity'), there are plenty of instances where we plan to spin off into other sectors and topics!


### - q: **okay, but... who are you?**
- a: mostly just one dude in the uk.

  **designing and building free resources like this to help people learn and grow their skills is something we have a passion for** here, and while we doubt this will reach too far, we'd much rather our stuff be out there.

  having some knowledge is great, even if we honestly have very little idea what we're doing, but **we'd love to be able to share this knowledge we have with others, for all it's worth**.

  so, this is a place for that, i suppose.

  we have a passion for computers, homelab, automation, development, hosting, tinkering, raspberry pis (and other sbcs), and many such matters. our thoughts and knowledge on these matters can reside here, all neatly consolidated and organised. hopefully. :')


### - q: **what might be here?**
- a: planned spin-offs, some of which are already accessible with some very early-access content and some of which deviate from the main, central focus of technology, include:

  - **labs**  -  for all things homelab, tinkering with such things, automation, scripts (e.g. convenience scripts), and the like!
  
  - **universe**  -  largely just a place for the organisation's creative works, which largely consist of digital art (and maybe a bit of storytelling?).
  
  - **human**  -  for resources surrounding equality, diversity and acceptance, and to help little people who find themselves in a big world.
    this may also feature resources for disabled / send students in public uk education, so those with neurodivergence, dyslexia and the like can get their access arrangements sorted.

  these subdomains, and the other such subdomains planned, **are to contain different styles of content**, and cover different flavours of topics, **though mainly just in relation to technology and education**.

  since they're not closely related in meaning and the types of content, these initially held different repos for each subdomain. however, we've since decided to unify our very thinly-spread development resources in the hopes that a rising tide may then lift our fleet of ships, so to speak.

  some of the beehive will likely blend human emotion, creation and expression with a digital twist or acceleration.
  however, **most of it will likely just be the sharing of tips, tricks and information surrounding computers, technology, and getting set up with various projects of your own**.

# conclusion

we really do hope you enjoy taking a look around or get something useful out of this. the code here is open-source, so you can take a peek around if you wish! :)
you can even contribute if you know how to code and are feeling particularly generous.

stay fresh, and thank you so much for stopping by!
