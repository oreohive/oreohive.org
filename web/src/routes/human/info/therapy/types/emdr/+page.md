# EMDR

# What is EMDR?

**EMDR** stands for *â€˜**eye** **movement** **desensitisation** and **reprocessing**â€™*.

EMDR is a type of therapy thatâ€™s often recommended for helping people whoâ€™ve experienced **traumatic events**, or possess a condition similar in presentation to (c)PTSD.

### In short, itâ€™s recommended for people with **traumatic memories**.

**EMDR**â€™s focus is **right in its name.**
Itâ€™s designed to help with **processing** â€˜stuckâ€™ memories, thoughts or feelings that might not have been **properly processed** by our minds yet.

## Some info about traumatic memories

**EMDR** uses something called the â€˜adaptive information processingâ€™ (AIP) model, which is a theory about how our minds store memories.

This model was developed by Francine Shapiro, who also devised EMDR.
It recognises that our minds store normal and particularly traumatic memories differently.

**During normal events, our mind stores memories smoothly.**

It also networks them, so they connect to other things we remember!

This means that we then have â€˜pathwaysâ€™ in our minds forming these networks, so some memories can be **triggered** by certain other memories or cues.

During traumatic events, though, that networking process might not happen correctly.

Because we feel in danger, our minds can rush the process of storing these memories properly, networking them appropriately, or struggle to process the emotions at all.

### So, traumatic memories can end up being stored in quite a messy way that doesnâ€™t really allow for normal, healthy healing.

Because the networking isnâ€™t done properly yet, newer experiences can then link up to earlier trauma experiences, which can reinforce a negative experience over and over again.

# What does EMDR look like?

Thereâ€™s no set image.

Some more unusual EMDR setups can leverage other means of stimuli like the tapping of the legs or vibrating motors held in the hands.

However, the **shared property** tends to be a light (on a screen or bar) that is **followed** and **kept in focus by the personâ€™s eyes**.

*My EMDR setup, as an example, was comprised just of an illuminated circle on a screen that can be switched through various patterns of varying intensities to follow (e.g. a figure eight pattern rather than just sweeping from side to side).*

</aside>

During a session, I was to be positioned **in a room with no other people or stimuli**, to complete the process alone until I'm' interrupted for a 'check-in'.
Iâ€™m told this is a **precautionary measure** to ensure that my **traumatic memories** are not instead **accidentally** associated with, say, **my therapist**.

*Itâ€™s thought by some that the more intense the stimulation, the more powerful and heavy EMDR can prove to be.
Some swear by the moving dot; others dismiss EMDR as a whole as childâ€™s play.*

## So, how can EMDR help us store these memories properly?

Good question!

In practice, the person being treated **focuses on a troubling or traumatic memory or image:**

- Then, they identify a feeling or belief they have (often about themself), thatâ€™s connected with this negative memory. For example, 'I am worthless'.

  *â€™I amâ€™ statements are very powerful here!*
  
  This negative statement is strictly NOT to be repeated for the rest of the session.

- The individual then formulates a positive belief that theyâ€™d like to have about themself in relation to the same memory.
- All the physical sensations and emotions accompanying the memory are identified.
- The individual then goes over the memory and focuses on it.
Hard. Like, really hard. Usually painfully hard. :â€™)
- However, they do this while maintaining a focus on an external stimulus, like a moving dot on a screen.

  This is the special part. This stimulus creates â€˜**bilateral**â€™ (side-to-side) **eye movement**.

- Itâ€™s at this point that both sides of the brain are stimulated, and its sectors are encouraged to communicate with each other.

  This can help a memory become â€˜unstuckâ€™ or properly mapped by letting our neural networks (re)connect more naturally.

---

*Itâ€™s also thought by some that EMDR creates a replica of our rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phase.*

*This is the state of sleep we enter in which mental recovery occurs, and memories can process naturally. EMDRâ€™s bilateral eye movements are thought to mimic REM sleep.*

---

- After each set of bilateral movements, the individual is asked **how they feel**.

This process may continue until the individual measures that the level of distress caused by the memory has lessened, usually on a scale (e.g. 1 to 7).

For example, in dealing with a rape, a person may believe *â€˜I am dirtyâ€™*.

This would be pronounced and identified towards the beginning, but during the memoryâ€™s remapping with the eye movements, this association would instead be turned into a more positive one, like *â€˜I am a worthwhile and good person in control of my lifeâ€™*.

This â€˜remappingâ€™ would be repeated until no more negative associations trigger distress, self-blame, panic or anxiety.

*The individual can start to develop more empowering perspectives of what happened, too, feeling more in control of their own mind as a result.*

*Over time, as this memory is revisited and reframed, the person can gain a sense of self-worth and control over the memory.*

## So, does it workâ€¦? And is it dangerous?!

Well, on paper, it certainly might seem like quite the stretch at first!

However, many have reported that EMDR has helped them deal with their traumatic memories.
Many go as far as to suggest itâ€™s easily the therapy to have worked most effectively in helping them deal with past traumatic events.

---

And no, EMDR is not dangerous. It presents no real such medical risks.

*If youâ€™re worried because youâ€™ve a familiarity with ECT (electroconvulsive / electroshock therapy), rest assured in that EMDR is entirely different.
ECT passes small electric currents through the brain, intentionally causing a brief seizure.
EMDR is nothing like this and doesnâ€™t pass anything through your brain.*

*EMDR has our brains go about their own processes, so they can properly process things that have happened to us.*
