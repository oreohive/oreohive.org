# Types of therapy

This is a page all about the **different types of therapy** you might have access to or might think about trying out.

*’Therapy’* doesn’t just mean the standard, stereotypical image of sitting on a sofa and talking to somebody about your problems.
Of course, such approaches can help some people.

However, because **all of our minds are so different**, there are **lots of different types** of therapy to accommodate our minds’ differences.
Our minds can have **very different ways** of dealing with things and **processing our lives**.

There are so many different types of therapy, we don’t think we could possibly cover them all here, but we’ll do our best to cover some key ones!

## *‘Talking therapy’*

Many forms of therapy are called *‘talking therapies’*.

A *‘talking therapy’* is just a therapy that involves talking to a trained professional about your thoughts, feelings or behaviour.

In a talking therapy, we might discuss what’s going on in our minds, and how that might make us feel.
Describing what’s going on in our minds (and describing how that makes us feel) can help us pick up on any patterns we might want to change.

## Not all therapies are talking therapies

The neat part is, though, not all therapies are talking therapies!
In fact, some types of therapy don’t even need us to talk about what’s on our mind at all!

### Why?

While some people find talking therapies useful for digesting traumatic events that might’ve happened to us, sometimes it can feel counterproductive.

Some therapies, like **EMDR**, fall somewhere in-between, not being considered a traditional talking therapy but involving elements of discussion.

EMDR’s signature emphasis is on **processing our memories**, rather than **exploring them in-depth** in conversations.
