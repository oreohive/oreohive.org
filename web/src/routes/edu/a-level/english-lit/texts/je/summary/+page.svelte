    <h2>Act I</h2>
    <h3>Captain Hardy and Second Lieutenant Osborne</h3>
    <p>
        The play opens in a dugout in the British trenches of Northern France,
        near St. Qeuntin.<br /><br />
        Captain Hardy is about to leave the dugout, for his position to be taken
        over by Osborne. The two discuss their higher-up, Captain Stanhope; Hardy
        is critical of the man, stating he 'drinks like a fish', but Osborne admires
        his great leadership.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>A new officer...?</h3>
    <p>
        Following Hardy's departure, we're introduced to a new officer, Raleigh.
        Raleigh is young, has attractive features, is healthy and active, and is
        bursting with energy to be fighting in the war.<br /><br />
        Raleigh has managed to secure himself a place in the company.<br /><br
        />He did this because he knew Stanhope at public school, and Stanhope's
        lover back at home (called Madge) is Raleigh's sister. Small world, eh?<br
        /><br />
        Anyway, Osborne cottons onto Raleigh's enthusiasm about re-meeting Stanhope.
        He tries to temper Raleigh's expectations, though, aware that Stanhope is
        very much a changed man since his school days.
    </p>
    <h3>Stanhope's reaction to this</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, after hearing of him from so many, we finally get to meet
        Stanhope for the first time.<br />I suppose we as an audience don't
        really know what to expect; some have said he's a drunkard, some have
        admired him, but he's clearly well-known either way.<br /><br />
        However, we don't get a Stanhope guzzling down alcohol. We don't get a noble
        warrior, either. We get... an uncomfortable Stanhope. One at quite an unease.<br
        /><br />
        He expresses to Osborne in private that he feels very uneasy about Raleigh's
        sudden presence.<br /><br />

        We soon learn, from observing the close interactions of the pair, that
        he is afraid of Raleigh sharing with Madge (Raleigh's sister and
        Stanhope's fianc√©) what Stanhope feels he has become.
