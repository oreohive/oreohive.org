# oreohive.org
**this is a git repo for the website hosted at oreohive.org.**
it includes its sveltekit frontend ('web'), its upcoming, planned api ('api'), and pretty much all surrounding workings.

this website is built with **sveltekit** + **vite**.

this website also has **msdvex built-in** (which interprets markdown files), so we can contribute and create pages **just by adding .md (markdown) files**! no code required!

## the purpose of this website

please read https://www.oreohive.org/about to learn about our mission and why we're here.
in short, we're here for **simpler software** and **easier experiences**. we feel the internet shouldn't have to be scary.

we wanted a place to share our knowledge of things we've learned, and keep it all nice and organised, while documenting it for public availability.

this is also largely a place for me to learn about webdev and the ins-and-outs of nodejs and our framework.

you can learn more about our opinions on the current state of technology, and why we feel there is a need for change, here: https://www.oreohive.org/activity-log/intro

we will likely, as part of the oreohive portfolio, build up simple tools that 'just work'; things like calculators and other silly internet tools will likely be added over time as we figure out how to best implement them. one of our earliest projects was called 'pitchplay', a simple tool that'd let you enter in two notes and inform you as to the multiplier you'd need to pitch the first to the second. we definitely intend on bringing this one back at some point.

any contributions, be they of code, ideas / suggestions, or both, are hugely appreciated. :))

thank you so much for stopping by, and i hope something we make, even if it's just one of our quick tutorials, can help you out someday. :>

## conclusion, and terms & ethics of use
in general, **it's highly unlikely you'll find us chasing people or entities over licensing crap if they're doing us no direct harm**. this is just to stop naughty people stealing our stuff without giving back to the community.

any and all of **your use of oreohive resources, resources published by the oreohive organisation** and / or resources under / in / a part of the oreohive project are **subject to our terms & ethics of use**. please find them on our website.

sensible inclusions of the oreohive(.org) name or logo in attributions, clearly as an effort to attribute or give credit rather than impersonate, do not count as infringing or disallowed use of the oreohive name or marks, silly.
