# oreohive.org
**this is a git repo for the website hosted at oreohive.org.**


this website is built with **sveltekit**. its sveltekit app is inside the 'web' directory.

this website also has **msdvex built-in** (which interprets markdown files), so we can contribute and create pages **just by adding .md (markdown) files**! no code required!

# the purpose of this website

please read https://www.oreohive.org/about to learn about our mission and why we're here.
in short, we're here for **simpler software** and **easier experiences**. we feel the internet shouldn't have to be scary.

we wanted a place to share our knowledge of things we've learned, and keep it all nice and organised, while documenting it for public availability.
this is also largely a place for me to learn about webdev and the ins-and-outs of nodejs and our framework.

you can learn more about our opinions on the current state of technology, and why we feel there is a need for change, here: https://www.oreohive.org/activity-log/intro

any contributions, be they of code, ideas / suggestions, or both, are hugely appreciated. :))

thank you so much for stopping by, and i hope something we make, even if it's just one of our quick tutorials, can help you out someday. :>

# wanna contribute?

we're so glad to hear it!!! i'm sure my source code i've cobbled together over the months of building this first project of mine could use some improvements.

- open a pull request against the main branch ('main' is our dev branch, 'release' is prod) explaining your changes
- ta-da!! we'll consider letting it in!! thank you so much! :D

we love crediting our contributors, so you can expect us to be singing your praises on the website. :'))
we'd love to hear what new features or fixes you have ideas for!!
