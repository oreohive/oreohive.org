# oreohive.org
**This is a Git repo for the website hosted at oreohive.org.** Our `main` branch is our central branch for development. Our `release` branch is the branch that release builds are built from.

This web app is built with **sveltekit**. its sveltekit app is inside the 'web' directory.

This web app also has `msdvex` built-in. This interprets markdown files for display as Svelte pages. This lets you contribute and create pages just by adding markdown (`.md`) files, no code required.

# The why

Please read [this](https://oreohive.org/about) to learn about our mission and why we're here. In short, we're here for **simpler software** and **easier experiences**. we feel the internet shouldn't have to be scary.

We wanted a place to share what we've learned, and keep it all nice and organised, while documenting it for public availability.
This is also largely a place for me to learn about webdev and the ins-and-outs of Node.js and our framework.

You can learn more about why we feel there is a need for change [here](https://oreohive.org/activity-log/intro).

Any contributions, be they of code, ideas, or both, are hugely appreciated. :))

Thank you so much for stopping by, and I hope something we make, even if it's just one of our quick tutorials, can help you out someday. :>

# Wanna contribute?

We're so glad to hear! I'm sure this code I've cobbled together could use some improvements.

- Fork the repo
- Open a pull request against the main branch ('main' is our dev branch, 'release' is prod) explaining your changes
- Ta-da! We'll consider letting it in, thank you so much! :D

We love crediting our contributors, so you can expect us to be singing your praises on the website.
We'd love to hear what new features or fixes you have ideas for.
